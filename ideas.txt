Preprocessing:
------------FIRST IDEA-----------
1) Use the first 4 seconds of resting of the experiment to create the create the baseline to clean the rest of the data (create the ICA, ect)
2) Feed the data to the ML algorithm


------------SECOND IDEA-----------
1) Use the first resting EEG of the patient to create the baseline to clean the other EEG's. The idea is to simulate an application that ask you to calibrate the application.
2) Feed the other EEG to the algorithme
